    <p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound kielbasa (pork or turkey), cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, cut into 6 wedges</li>
            <li>1 pound frozen potato-and-cheddar pierogies (do not thaw)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Preparation Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill to medium. Grill the kielbasa, turning, 
                <br>
                until marked, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet 
                <br>
                or platter.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk the mustard and vinegar in a large bowl. 
                <br>
                Slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil until smooth.</li>
            <li>Toss the onion and pierogies with the remaining 2 tablespoons 
                <br>
                olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, covered, until 
                <br>
                the pierogies thaw and the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.
                <br>
                Turn the pierogies and onion and continue to grill, covered, until 
                <br>
                the pierogies are cooked through and the onion is tender, 4 to 6 more
                <br>
                minutes. Transfer to the baking sheet or platter.</li> 
            <li>Slice the kielbasa into pieces and add to the bowl with the mustard 
                <br>
                dressing. Roughly chop the onion and add to the bowl along with the 
                <br>
                pierogies and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and toss. Divide among 
                <br>
                shallow bowls.
            </li>           
        </ol>
